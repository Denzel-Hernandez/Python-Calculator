# Python Calculator

A command-line **advanced calculator** built using **Python**. This calculator supports basic arithmetic, advanced mathematical functions, variable assignments, and history tracking. The calculator also provides help commands for ease of use.

## Features
- **Basic arithmetic operations**: Addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), modulus (%), and exponentiation (**).
- **Advanced functions**: Sine (sin), cosine (cos), tangent (tan), logarithm (log, log10), square root (sqrt), and factorial.
- **Variable assignment**: Assign values to variables and use them in expressions.
- **History tracking**: View and clear the history of calculations.
- **Help command**: Provides a list of available commands and functions.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **math** module (for advanced mathematical functions)

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Advanced-Python-Calculator.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory and run the calculator script:
   ```bash
   python calculator.py
   ```
3. Start entering expressions, variables, or use commands like `help` or `history`.

## Usage Examples
- **Basic operations**: `2 + 3 * 4`
- **Using variables**: 
  ``` 
  x = 10
  x ** 2 
  ```
- **Advanced functions**:
  - `sin(pi / 2)`
  - `log(10)`
  - `sqrt(16)`
  
## Available Commands
- `help`: Shows the list of available commands and examples.
- `history`: Displays the history of all calculations performed in the session.
- `clear`: Clears the calculation history.
- `exit`: Exits the calculator.

## Future Improvements
- Add support for **additional mathematical functions** like hyperbolic functions.
- Implement **file-based history tracking** so users can view previous sessions.
- Add more **customizable settings** for precision and rounding.
